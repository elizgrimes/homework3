The solution to level 24:

flex-direction: column-reverse;
flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
justify-content: center;
align-content: space-between;

// Changes orientation of the frogs so that they are vertical
// Also changes direction to yellow, green, red instead of red, green, yellow
flex-direction: column-reverse;

// Wraps the frogs so that the yellow frogs are in a separate column-reverse
// Reverse part puts the yellow frogs on the left so they are on the same side
// as the yellow lilypads
// The red and green frogs are now on their lilypads
flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;

// Moves the yellow frogs so that they are vertically centered like the yellow lilypads
justify-content: center;

// Puts the same amount of space between the column of yellow frogs and the column
// of green and red frogs, which forces the yellow frogs to line up with the yellow lilypads
align-content: space-between;
